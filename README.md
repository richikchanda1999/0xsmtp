# 0x SMTP - Send emails to your 0x address

This is the frontend for assisting you with sending emails to your 0x address. It is a simple interface that creates a map of your email addresses to 0x addresses and then all emails to the 0x address are routed to the original email address.

The backend can be found at [SMTP Backend](https://github.com/prasunka/postal-routing-server).
